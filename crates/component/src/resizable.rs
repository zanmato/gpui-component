//! What this design system paints inside a resize handle.
//!
//! Base owns the band, the cursor and the drag; everything here is appearance.
//! A divider rests as the same hairline it has always been, and answers the
//! pointer with a pill that grows and solidifies as the pointer engages it:
//! available, held, being dragged.
